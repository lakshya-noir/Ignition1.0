## Overview
Smart Rider+ is a **real-time activity tracking app** that uses **mobile sensors** (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, GPS) to detect and differentiate between **walking, biking, and scooter riding**.  

It also supports **phone mirroring** using **ApowerMirror**, allowing the app display to be viewed on another device for monitoring or demonstration purposes.

## Features
- **Real-time sensor tracking:** Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and GPS data collection.  
- **Activity recognition:** Automatically classifies walking, biking, or scooter riding.  
- **Interactive map display:** Shows real-time location and route traveled.  
- **Data visualization:** Speed, distance, and activity type shown in real-time.  
- **Phone mirroring support:** View the app on another device using **ApowerMirror**.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works on both Android and iOS devices via **Expo Go**.

## How It Works
1. **Sensors:**  
   - **Accelerometer:** Measures linear acceleration (x, y, z axes).  
   - **Gyroscope:** Measures angular velocity and rotation.  
   - **GPS:** Tracks location, speed, and distance.

2. **Activity Recognition:**  
   - Uses sensor data to classify movement into walking, biking, or scooter riding in real-time.

3. **Map Display:**  
   - Displays the user’s route and current location on a map interface.

4. **Screen Mirroring with ApowerMirror:**  
   - Mirror the rider's phone to another device in real-time.  
   - Ideal for demonstrations or monitoring without physically holding the phone.

## Requirements
- **Mobile device (Android or iOS)** with sensors and GPS.  
- **Expo Go app** installed to run Smart Rider+ on the phone.  
- **ApowerMirror** (optional) for screen mirroring.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-rider.git
   cd smart-rider


2. Install dependencies:
   npm install


3. Start the app using Expo:
  npx expo start


4. Scan the QR code using Expo Go on your mobile device to open the app.
   
   
5. Using ApowerMirror for Display
 Install ApowerMirror on both devices (rider’s phone and viewing device).
 Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network or use USB connection.
 On the rider’s phone, select Phone Screen Mirroring and choose the target device.
 The app display will appear on the mirrored device in real-time.
